DAG-
Directed Acyclic Graph

Topo sort only possible in DAG

->Linear ordering of vertices such that for every edge u ->v, u always occurs before v,

=>> Use DFS Traversal and a Stack
put element x in the stack after  completing all the dfs traversal from point x

and now the stack will give our topological sort order.
